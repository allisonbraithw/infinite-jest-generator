## Description

infinite-jest-generator is a cutting-edge application that leverages the power of AI to bring to life the characters from the classic novel "Infinite Jest". 

Technically it could work for any novel you have a PDF of, but I made this for a specific bookclub.

## Features

- Generate detailed images of main characters like Hal Incandenza, Don Gately, and Joelle Van Dyne.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/infinite-jest-generator.git

```

3. Create the `data` directory and save the pdf you want to query there
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your openAI credentials
```

```

3. Install the required dependencies:
